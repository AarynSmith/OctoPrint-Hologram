OctoPrint Hologram plugin
=========================
This plugin allows a user to an accurate preview of their print projected onto the build plate. Designed for cameras mounted on the build plates.

Example Usage
-------------
Generate a render by loading the print file, clicking the render button and it overlays a render onto the build plate.

Raspberry Pi
------------
Since this plugin depends on Numpy you many have to run the following.
- sudo apt-get install libopenblas-base
- sudo ldconfig

See: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html

Future plans
------------
To automatically detect failures and defects in real-time by cross comparing the rendered model with the actual print, layer by layer. If a certain confidence level is met, the print will be paused. Check the pre-releases for more information.
